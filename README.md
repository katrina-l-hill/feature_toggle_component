# Creating a Feature Toggle Component in React

# Author: Katrina Hill

# Report

The goal of this project is to create a reusable component that renders different content based on the value of a prop (`isEnabled`). This showcases conditional rendering in React.

A challenge faced for this project included understanding conditional rendering, but this was overcome by focusing on understanding how React component re-render based on changing props and how conditional logic (if, ternary operators, etc.) can control the content rendered by the component.
